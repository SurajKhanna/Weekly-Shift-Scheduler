# 🗓️ Employee Weekly Shift Scheduler

A beautiful, interactive **weekly roster generator** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It automatically assigns shifts with rules, allows **week-by-week navigation**, and supports **Excel export**.

## 💡 Why I Built This?

A friend once told me how her manager spends hours every week preparing the shift roster manually.  
It wasn’t just a simple list – there were many rules to keep in mind:  
- Only a limited number of people can take leave on the same day  
- Departments can’t be understaffed  
- Some employees prefer specific timings  

Doing this by hand again and again was tiring, error-prone, and honestly unfair to her manager’s time.  

That’s when I thought – *why not create something small that can actually help?*  
A tool that looks modern, works quickly, and saves precious hours every week.  

This project isn’t about fancy tech – it’s about solving a real problem with a simple, thoughtful solution.  
If it makes someone’s work-life easier, even a little, then the effort was completely worth it ❤️
